/// @brief Class managing an instance of TableDataSource object
/// @details This class is created as part of ContinuumWorker refactoring. It provides caching logic which
/// allows us to avoid closing and opening the same dataset unnecessarily. There was also some cleanup logic
/// in the code prior to refactoring the necessity of which is not entirely clear to me (MV) as it should've happened
/// in the destructors. It is possible that the cleanup was needed due to an unrelated bug which I fixed as part of 
/// the refactoring (there was an unnecessary copy of the DataSource object). But for now I just move the original
/// clean up code here. If necessary, caching logic could be made more advanced later on (e.g. to allow simultaneous 
/// opening of multiple datasets).
