/// @file
/// @brief Class encapsulating uv-weights related interactions with the Params class
/// @details We ultimately store and ship around uv weights in the Params class (same as, for example, the  model). 
/// It is handy to gather all required operations in one place, so we're always consistent with parameter naming, etc.
/// Index translation is usually not possible to derive from parameters themselves and, besides, we can have different
/// mapping for research purposes (e.g. applying the weight determined for one beam to the other, etc) or use more
/// complex strategy in the future. This complexity should probably be handled through this class too.
/// @note The uv weights are always stored as single precision floats (this is sufficient for weights as they're in
/// the uv domain), but arrays in Params can be both double and single precision floats depending on the compile flags
/// (look for imtype typedef). As a result, having double precision option used would result in two copies of the weight
/// grid to exist (one in Params as double and one in the applicator as float) as opposed to reference semantics. If we
/// want to fix this, we'd probably have to implement run time coexistance of float and double parameters (as opposed to
/// compile time switch via imtype).
///
/// the parameters corresponding to uv-weights have the following style:
///     uvweight.name.index where name corresponds to the image parameter name the particular weight applies to and
///                         index is an unsigned integer index corresponding to the index used in the collection.
///     a special uvweight_indices.name parameter describes index translation coefficients (expected to be a 3-element vector). 
///     If absent, the trivial translation is assumed and only weights with index=0 should be present. Note, this is the area
///     where future changes are likely and low-level details are hidden from the end user on purpose. The index translator is
///     returned or setup via the interface (IUVWeightIndexTranslator) and this class is responsible for describing it right in
///     the Params class.
/// 
///   allow wildcard in name?
